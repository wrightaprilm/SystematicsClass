# Final Project Guidelines

## Before the final

- 10 pts: Register your topic with me (you've all already done this)
- 30 pts: Provide me with details of how you did your analysis, including:
  - Details of software used
  - Specific commands used
  - Any data files
  - This can be in whatever format you want (Word doc, text file, R Markdown)
- 10 pts: I will try to reproduce what you've said you did. If it all works out, you get the full 50 points.
