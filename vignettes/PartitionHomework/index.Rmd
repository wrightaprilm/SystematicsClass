We'll be doing something a little different for this week's homework. There will not be a question set to answer for this one. Download the files `bears.nex` and `bears.cytb` from [here](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/fbd/). 

In the script we created in class ("partition_data_lab/mcmc_partition_morphology.Rev"), write a script in which:

+ Morphology is modeled via the Mk model
+ Molecules are modeled via GTR + G model
+ Both data sources contribute to the tree
+ An MCC tree is computed

Save the script on your RStudio. I will retrieve it from your RStudio after class April 5.

Run the script to convergence. When I go to check this, I will be checking: 

+ That the script runs
+ The mcmc converges
+ A tree file is there
